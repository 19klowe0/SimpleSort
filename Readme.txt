Simple sort in python 

Okay so, 
I could not figure out how to use a linux environment on windows it just couldn't be done. 
I tried for a long time and it just didn't work. I watched so many videos. 
I have the code and it sorts everything correctly. 
I'll keep trying to figure linux out but I know I won't be able to in a short period of time so I want those few on time points for the assignment. 
I will work on my linux skills the remainer of my college career. 
I'm just a sophmore and because of the way the program is laid out I haven't worked with virtual machines at all. ever. in my whole life. 
but I will now!

I used pycharm as my IDE 

here is what I wanted you to be able to do~
 
Open your linux virtual machine 
make sure to navigate to to the directory KiraLoweSort 
from here run "main.py" 

Thank you for understanding, 
Kira Lowe.

Simple sort in python 

before you begin make sure that output1 and output2 are empty 

Open your command prompt
make sure to navigate to the file in your directory

from here run the command type SortMe.txt | python main.py > output1.txt
and run the command type SortMe.txt | python ReverseSort.py > output2.txt
 Doing this save the output of the two programs into their own separate text files. 

You can now open the output files and see the output of the programs 

To test the files double click on the test.bat file and you should recieve the message that no differences are detected. This means that the programs returned the right sorted files.
